<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This is the <b>filtered</b> version of the corpus. Due to copyright restrictions we are not allowed to publish the whole dataset.
This version comprises all dictionary and wordlist entries that contain at maximum one word which has a stem that belongs to one
of the words in the Spanish swadesh list. We used the entries of the
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Spanish_Swadesh_list">Wikipedia swadesh list</a> to filter our data. Each entry of
the swadesh list and each entry of our sources was stemmed using the <a href="http://nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/snowball.html">
Snowball stemmer of the NLTK</a> and then compared the the swadesh stem. In case of equality the entry is included in the data you
will find here.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we included one of the sources without any filter, so you have full access to the complete data:
<a href="http://www.quanthistling.info/data/source/thiesen1998/dictionary-25-339.html">Thiesen, Wesley & Thiesen, Eva. 1998.
Diccionario Bora—Castellano Castellano—Bora</a>.

<h2>Downloads</h2>
<p>
There are two download packages that contain the data from the whole corpus. One contain CSV files and only includes heads and translations in
the case of the dictionary sources, or concepts and counterparts in the case of wordlist sources. You may uses this data in combination
with the <a href="http://lingulist.de/lingpy/">lingpy libary</a>, for example. The other packages contains the complete basic data and annotations
encoded as <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=37326">ISO 24612</a> (GrAF/XML files). These files
can be parsed and accesed with the <a href="https://github.com/cidles/graf-python">graf-python library</a>, for example. The download links are:
<ul>
<li>CSV files: <a href="http://www.quanthistling.info/data/downloads/csv/data.zip">http://www.quanthistling.info/data/downloads/csv/data.zip</a></li>
